### Prerequisites

You need to install Eclipse as a devleppoment tool.

```
We used 3 libraries :

commons-csv-1.5.jar
json-20170516.jar
json-simple-1.1.jar
```


## Deployment

```
We launch the application
```

To begin with, we type the "word" that we're looking for. Secondly, we type the number of results that we want.
After that we get a list of search results and we have to choise one of them.

Once we have the key of that word, we can download the properties that we'll compare and generate in a CSV File.
